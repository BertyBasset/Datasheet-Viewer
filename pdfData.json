The device also features a 13th simulated electrode that represents the simultaneous charging of all the electrodes connected together to allow for increased proximity detection in a touch panel or touch screen array.","Keywords":["MPR121"," Proximity Capacitive Touch Sensor Controller"," second generation"," MPR03x series"," capacitance detection engine"," I2C address"," independent electrodes"," built-in autoconfiguration"],"Pages":27},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\MT306 DCtoDV convertor.pdf","Title":"DATASHEET SEARCH SITE | WWW.ALLDATASHEET.COM","Author":"Provided By ALLDATASHEET.COM(FREE DATASHEET DOWNLOAD SITE)","Subject":"DATASHEET SEARCH, DATABOOK, COMPONENT, FREE DOWNLOAD SITE","Keywords":["PDF"," DATASHEET"," PDF DATASHEET"," IC"," CHIP"," SEMICONDUCTOR"," TRANSISTOR"," ELECTRONIC COMPONENT"," ISO COMPONENT"," ALLDATASHEET"," DATABOOK"," CATALOG"," ARCHIVE"],"Pages":7},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PCDuino.pdf","Title":"ManualsLib - Makes it easy to find manuals online!","Author":"Provided By MANUALSLIB.COM - http://www.manualslib.com/","Subject":"Search through 700.000 manuals online \u0026 and download pdf manuals.","Keywords":["manuals"," instruction manuals"," user manuals"," service manuals"," user guides"," pdf manuals"," owners manuals"," installation guides "],"Pages":15},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC10F200_202_204_206.pdf","Title":"PIC10F200/202/204/206 Data Sheet","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"","Keywords":["DS40001239F"," DS40001239"," 40001239A"," 40001239"],"Pages":88},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC12F508_509_16F505.pdf","Title":"PIC12F508/509/16F505 8/14-Pin, 8-Bit Flash MCU Data Sheet","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"Data Sheet","Keywords":["PIC12F508"," PIC12F509","  PIC16F505"," DS41236E"," DS41236"," 41236E"," 41236"," Pic"],"Pages":110},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC12F629.pdf","Title":"PIC12F629/675 Data Sheet","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"Data Sheet","Keywords":["PIC12F629"," PIC12F675"," DS41190G"," DS41190"," 41190G"," 41190"],"Pages":136},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC16C5x.pdf","Title":"PIC16C5X.book","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":[],"Pages":192},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC16F18446-Curiosity-Nano.pdf","Title":"PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano Hardware User Guide","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"The PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit is a hardware platform for evaluating the PIC16F18446 microcontroller.","Keywords":["Microchip"," DS50002808"," PIC16F18446"," PIC"," User Guide"," Hardware"," Evaluation Kit"," MCU"," Microcontroller"," Curiosity Nano"," nEDBG"," Embedded Debugger"," Programmer"," Toolkit"," PKoB nano"],"Pages":37},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC16F5x.pdf","Title":"41213D.book","Author":"","Subject":"","Keywords":[],"Pages":88},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC16F62x.pdf","Title":"PIC16F62X FLASH-Based 8-Bit CMOS MCU Data Sheet","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"PIC16F62X Data Sheet","Keywords":["PIC16F62X"," PIC16F627"," PIC16F628"," PIC16LF627"," PIC16LF628"," PDIP"," SOIC"," SSOP"," FLASH"," CMOS"," Microcontroller"],"Pages":170},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC16F631_677_685_687_689_690.pdf","Title":"PIC16F631/677/685/687/689/690 Data Sheet","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"","Keywords":["DS40001262F"," DS40001262"," 40001262F"," 40001262"],"Pages":298},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\PIC32MX1XX2XX 283644-PIN_Datasheet_DS60001168L.pdf","Title":"PIC32MX1XX/2XX 28/36/44-pin Family Data Sheet","Author":"Microchip Technology Inc.","Subject":"PIC32MX1XX/2XX 28/36/44-PIN Family Data Sheet","Keywords":["\u0022PIC32"," 32-bit Flash"," Microcontroller\u0022"," PIC32MX1XX/2XX 28/36/44-pin Family Data Sheet"," PIC32MX1XX/2XX 28/36/44-pin"," PIC32MX1XX/2XX 28/36/44 data sheet"," PIC"," PIC32"," PIC32MX"," DS"," DS60001168L"," DS60001168"," DS60001168A"," DS60001168B"," DS60001168C"," DS60001168D"," DS60001168E"," DS60001168F"," DS60001168G"," DS60001168J"," DS60001168L"," DS60001168K"," 60001168"],"Pages":350},{"Path":"Microcontrollers\\Pico_Audio_Amplifier.pdf","Title":"PAM8901 / PAM8908","Author":"Diodes Incorporated","Subject":"25mW TRUE CAP FREE STEREO HEADPHONE AMPLIFIER","Keywords":["The PAM8901 / PAM8908 stereo headphone driver is designed for portable equipment where board space is at a premium.
